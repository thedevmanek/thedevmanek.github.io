    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/../blog_images/learning.oreilly.jpeg" alt="Image"></p><blockquote><p>Disclaimer: I hereby declare that I have been solicited by Maran Fernandes to furnish authentic feedback regarding the book titled “Developing IoT Projects with ESP32-Second Edition.” It is imperative to underscore that my evaluation remains entirely impartial, and I wish to emphasize that neither Mr. Fernandes nor his team has exerted any influence upon me to render a partial judgment. The opinions and remarks articulated in this blog post are exclusively my own, with the sole intention of providing insights to the best of my capability.<br>Cheers! 🍻</p></blockquote><h1 id="An-Overview"><a href="#An-Overview" class="headerlink" title="An Overview:"></a>An Overview:</h1><p>Upon delving into the initial pages, I swiftly grasped the book’s overarching objective. It endeavors to explore the IoT ecosystem through diverse examples, skillfully balancing practical applications with essential theoretical underpinnings. Each chapter seamlessly commences with fundamental theories, key concepts, or a project blueprint, seamlessly transitioning to the practical implementation through code.</p><h1 id="The-Review"><a href="#The-Review" class="headerlink" title="The Review"></a>The Review</h1><p>The book positions itself not as the definitive guide to ESP32 but as a valuable companion for comprehending and implementing a myriad of examples that showcase the robust capabilities of ESP32-based systems and ESP-IDF. It offers a distinctive perspective on IoT, aiming to maximize knowledge in my humble opinion.</p><h2 id="The-Dilemma-of-Target-Audience-👥"><a href="#The-Dilemma-of-Target-Audience-👥" class="headerlink" title="The Dilemma of Target Audience 👥"></a>The Dilemma of Target Audience 👥</h2><p>This book is not tailored for absolute beginners or hobbyists; both may find the substantial amount of code and theoretical content challenging, especially if they lack prior experience with electronics or object-oriented programming (OOP). While the book doesn’t explicitly position itself for novices, it remains firmly rooted in the technical aspects of IoT, providing extensive insights into using PlatformIO and ESP-IDF.</p><h2 id="A-Unique-Programming-Language-Choice-💻"><a href="#A-Unique-Programming-Language-Choice-💻" class="headerlink" title="A Unique Programming Language Choice 💻"></a>A Unique Programming Language Choice 💻</h2><p>Rather than utilizing Arduino C++ or MISRA C, the book adopts a robust C++-based system for ESP-IDF. While this language choice may initially surprise readers, a deeper exploration in later chapters reveals its purpose—to maintain consistency with libraries and leverage object-oriented programming for enhanced code modularity. The initial hesitation I felt was quickly overcome as the rationale became apparent.</p><h2 id="The-Exponential-Curve-📈"><a href="#The-Exponential-Curve-📈" class="headerlink" title="The Exponential Curve 📈"></a>The Exponential Curve 📈</h2><p>The book sets a deliberate pace in the first and second chapters, gradually intensifying in the third. While it attempts to sustain this momentum, the need to cover substantial content in smaller chapters presents a challenge. Keeping up with the increasing complexity may become demanding in the later chapters.</p><h2 id="Managing-Expectations"><a href="#Managing-Expectations" class="headerlink" title="Managing Expectations"></a>Managing Expectations</h2><p>Prospective buyers should not expect exhaustive coverage of ESP-IDF and IoT; disappointment awaits those seeking comprehensive insights. The book serves as a tool to reinforce prior knowledge of IoT systems and C++, facilitating the creation of practical, real-life projects that can serve as a foundation for future endeavors.</p><h2 id="The-Internet-Part-☁"><a href="#The-Internet-Part-☁" class="headerlink" title="The Internet Part ☁"></a>The Internet Part ☁</h2><p>Despite the title’s emphasis on the Internet aspect of IoT, the book remains narrowly focused on IoT concepts, omitting coverage of Bluetooth, Zigbee, and other essential protocols. While the decision to maintain focus is understood, a brief introduction to these technologies could have added valuable context.</p><h2 id="Hardware-Requirements-🔌"><a href="#Hardware-Requirements-🔌" class="headerlink" title="Hardware Requirements 🔌"></a>Hardware Requirements 🔌</h2><p>To follow along, readers are required to invest at least $80 in hardware. Despite potential backlash, I commend the authors for this decision, as adequate hardware is essential for a meaningful learning experience. Taking a firm stand on this ensures readers gain practical insights from the book.</p><h2 id="Book-Design-🎯"><a href="#Book-Design-🎯" class="headerlink" title="Book Design 🎯"></a>Book Design 🎯</h2><p>The book employs a unique design, delving into theory, hardware, software, and troubleshooting in each chapter. While the first three aspects are adequately covered, troubleshooting is addressed in a chapter-specific manner. Given that troubleshooting is integral to IoT, a more comprehensive approach in helping readers understand and overcome failures would be beneficial.</p><h2 id="Holding-Hands-🤝"><a href="#Holding-Hands-🤝" class="headerlink" title="Holding Hands 🤝"></a>Holding Hands 🤝</h2><p>The book adopts a guiding approach, holding readers’ hands through each step. While this may enhance reader satisfaction, it could hinder true learning, as some readers may resort to copying code without fully grasping the concepts. The increasing pace in later chapters may result in reader frustration and potential abandonment.</p><h1 id="Final-Words"><a href="#Final-Words" class="headerlink" title="Final Words"></a>Final Words</h1><p>Despite its caveats, the book effectively achieves its intended goals, offering a comprehensive exploration of TinyML and Edge Computing concepts. I wholeheartedly recommend it as a must-read for individuals keen on IoT, possessing a good-enough programming background. Even those already entrenched in the industry may find this book surprising, thanks to its distinctive approach to programming and insightful explanations of various libraries. The author’s wealth of experiences contributes significantly to making this book a compelling and enriching read.</p><h1 id="Where-to-buy"><a href="#Where-to-buy" class="headerlink" title="Where to buy?"></a>Where to buy?</h1><p>You can buy this book on the Packt’s website</p>]]></content>

Code modularity is crucial, and in ESP-IDF, we achieve that by creating components. However, creating a component requires some knowledge of CMake and C. A component is essentially a standalone set of code that can be used in the main file or other components. Here’s a quick look at my code structure.</p><figure class="highlight stylus"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br><span class="line">19</span><br><span class="line">20</span><br><span class="line">21</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">├── CMakeLists<span class="selector-class">.txt</span></span><br><span class="line">├── components</span><br><span class="line">│   ├── common</span><br><span class="line">│   │   ├── nimble_central_utils</span><br><span class="line">│   │   └── nimble_peripheral_utils</span><br><span class="line">│   └── nimble-ble-prph</span><br><span class="line">│       ├── CMakeLists<span class="selector-class">.txt</span></span><br><span class="line">│       ├── gatt_svr<span class="selector-class">.c</span></span><br><span class="line">│       ├── include</span><br><span class="line">│       ├── Kconfig<span class="selector-class">.projbuild</span></span><br><span class="line">│       └── nimble-ble-prph<span class="selector-class">.c</span></span><br><span class="line">├── dependencies<span class="selector-class">.lock</span></span><br><span class="line">├── LICENSE</span><br><span class="line">├── <span class="selector-tag">main</span></span><br><span class="line">│   ├── CMakeLists<span class="selector-class">.txt</span></span><br><span class="line">│   ├── idf_component<span class="selector-class">.yml</span></span><br><span class="line">│   └── <span class="selector-tag">main</span><span class="selector-class">.c</span></span><br><span class="line">├── README<span class="selector-class">.md</span></span><br><span class="line">├── sdkconfig</span><br><span class="line">├── sdkconfig<span class="selector-class">.defaults</span></span><br><span class="line">└── sdkc</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The <code>common</code> directory holds essential files frequently utilized alongside a module.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="My-Setup"><a href="#My-Setup" class="headerlink" title="My Setup"></a>My Setup</h2><p>I’ve chosen CLion as my weapon of choice for this project, thanks to its slick built-in MISRA C support (we’ll dig into that later). Currently, I’m cruising on my Dell G15 5515 Ryzen edition, running a dual-boot setup with Windows 11 and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (Yep, I’ve played with Arch, but no way am I sacrificing ROS for it!) </p><h2 id="Starting-Fresh-with-ESP-IDF"><a href="#Starting-Fresh-with-ESP-IDF" class="headerlink" title="Starting Fresh with ESP-IDF"></a>Starting Fresh with ESP-IDF</h2><p>I began by installing ESP-IDF from scratch. Everything seemed fine until I tried to install the specific esp32-c6 version. The compiler didn’t find ‘xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc’, which was weird for a fresh install.</p><figure class="highlight ruby"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="title class_">CMake</span> <span class="title class_">Error</span> at /home/thedevmanek/esp/esp-idf/tools/cmake/project.<span class="symbol">cmake:</span><span class="number">448</span> </span><br><span class="line">(__project)<span class="symbol">:The</span> <span class="variable constant_">CMAKE_C_COMPILER</span><span class="symbol">:xtensa-esp32-elf-gcc</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>To fix this, I reinstalled ESP-IDF without specifying the chip version, and that worked like a charm. I ran the “hello-world” example, and yay, it worked!</p><h2 id="Getting-the-Project-on-Track"><a href="#Getting-the-Project-on-Track" class="headerlink" title="Getting the Project on Track"></a>Getting the Project on Track</h2><p>I believe in starting a project right, and that means having a solid <a href="https://github.com/thedevmanek/assistive-shoulder-firmware/blob/main/README.md">README.md</a>. I goofed a bit during a pull request (PR) – didn’t do the squash and merge thing 😭. No worries, though. I fixed it by reverting, adding a note about squash and merge in the README, and finally merging the PR.</p><p>Now, let’s talk security for PRs. I added some important stuff:</p><ul><li><strong>Only Verified Commits Allowed:</strong> Making sure each commit is legit.</li><li><strong>Need at Least 1 Review to Merge:</strong> Double-checking things with another set of eyes.</li><li><strong>Sort Out Comments Before Merging:</strong> Making sure all comments are resolved before the merge happens.</li></ul><p>These steps might sound like a lot, but they’re just my way of making sure our project stays strong and secure.</p><p>Whenever I start a new project on GitHub, I make it a point to create a fresh file in the Projects folder. This little step goes a long way in keeping things organized. It’s like having a virtual whiteboard where I jot down features and track progress. Plus, it acts as a public commitment, showing that I’m all in for the success of the project. It’s my way of saying, “Hey world, here’s what we’re working on, and we’re committed to making it awesome!” 🚀</p><h2 id="Some-Test-with-Bluetooth"><a href="#Some-Test-with-Bluetooth" class="headerlink" title="Some Test with Bluetooth"></a>Some Test with Bluetooth</h2><h3 id="Bluetooth-Testing-and-ESP32-C6-Quirk"><a href="#Bluetooth-Testing-and-ESP32-C6-Quirk" class="headerlink" title="Bluetooth Testing and ESP32-C6 Quirk"></a>Bluetooth Testing and ESP32-C6 Quirk</h3><blockquote><p>Pro tip: Stick to examples from the esp-idf installation folder. It’s a good shield against the notorious big breaking changes. And hey, consider using the LTS version for a smoother ride – fewer surprises, fewer changes to handle.</p></blockquote><p>I ran some Bluetooth tests to ensure everything was smooth, but here’s the catch: ESP32-C6 doesn’t work with Bluetooth classic; it only supports BLE. Save yourself from potential debugging headaches like this.</p><figure class="highlight vbnet"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">undefined reference <span class="keyword">to</span> `esp_ble_gap_start_advertising<span class="comment">&#x27;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="symbol">collect2:</span> <span class="keyword">error</span>: ld returned <span class="number">1</span> <span class="keyword">exit</span> status</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><blockquote><p>Quick tip: Always check the board compatibility info in the examples.
